<p>Sydney is defined in the eyes of its people and globally by spectacular ocean beaches and waterways.</p>

<p>Our magnificent, but vulnerable shorelines put us on the frontline of some of the world’s most confronting environmental challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rising sea levels</li>
<li>Ocean acidification </li>
<li>Toxic marine pollution</li>
<li>Shark conservation or culling</li>
<li>Making seafood sustainable</li>
</ul>

<p>While the challenges are global, often the causes and solutions can be local – so what we do can make a difference!</p>

<p><em>The Greenhouse</em> is bringing together top campaigners to confront our marine challenges, and to explore what needs to be done on the Shoreline Frontline.</p>
