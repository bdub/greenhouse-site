<h2>Shoreline Frontline</h2>

<h3>Can we make the 'oceans &amp; us' relationship sustainable?</h3>

<h4>Tuesday 5th April 6-9pm</h4>

<p>Sydney is defined in the eyes of its people and globally by spectacular ocean beaches and waterways. Our magnificent, but vulnerable shorelines put us on the frontline of some of the world’s most confronting environmental challenges:</p>

<li>Ocean acidification</li>
<li>Toxic marine pollution</li>
<li>Shark conservation or culling</li>
<li>Making seafood sustainable</li>
</ul>

<p>While the challenges are global, often the causes and solutions can be local - so what we do can make a difference!</p>
