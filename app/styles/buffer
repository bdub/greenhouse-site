Sydney is defined in the eyes of its people and globally by spectacular ocean beaches and waterways.

Our magnificent shorelines put us on the frontline of some of the world’s most confronting environmental challenges:

 - Rising sea levels
 - Ocean acidification 
 - Toxic marine pollution
 - Shark conservation or culling
 - Making seafood sustainable
 
While the challenges are global, often the causes and solutions can be local – so what we do can make a difference!
