<h2 class="text-center">How Tech Can Save The Planet - An Event Series</h2>

<h4 class="text-muted text-center">presented by<br/>GreenUps, EnergyLabs, WWF <span class="text-danger">and you!</span></h4>

<h2 class="text-center">Sponsorship Proposal</h2>

<p class="sponsorintro">After a successful 2016 program at the Powerhouse Museum, The Greenhouse is back for another season exploring progressive, sustainable and ecologically intelligent solutions to the really hard problems - this year we're at a new venue inside UTS Blackfriars, and with some great new partners and friends. </p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<blockquote>
	<p>The Greenhouse Project is an exercise in capacity building, community engagement, and awareness, designed to build a bridge between Sydney's tech-startup and entrepreneurial ecosystem and the environmental and NGO communities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Through a series of interconnected events we aim to develop a community of interest around finding cutting-edge solutions to some of the big environmental challenges.</p>

<p>The six-monthly event program will culminate with a summit-style Ideation &amp; Hackathon, inspired by the themes and challenges explored during the preceding program, and act as the launchpad for potential new projects and opportunities.</p>

<p>We're looking for key sponsors to take along on the journey with us over the next six months and beyond, to be intimately inter-woven into the project's fabric, during the live events, the intervening community engagement (via the programming partners extensive social media and traditional marketing channels, including radio, mailing-lists), and for posterity via event live-video recordings and post-event blogs.  </p>

<p class="text-primary" ><strong>Based on the 2016 series, we expect to attract over 1,000 people to the combined series.</strong></p>

<h4>The event series comprises:</h4>

  <ul>
  	<li><p><strong><em>30 May</em></strong> - Series Launch <strong>Planet Saving Technology</strong> - What are the global megatrends and what are the biggest opportunities for planet-saving disruption?</p></li>
  	<li><p><strong><em>27 June</em></strong> - How <strong>Smart Cities</strong> will change the way we organise our lives and bring about the third industrial revolution.</p></li>
  	<li><p><strong><em>25 July</em></strong> - How <strong>Blockchain</strong> will bring power to the people and revolutionise consumption and production</p></li>
  	<li><p><strong><em>29 August</em></strong> - How <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> and <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> can be harnessed for social and environmental impact.</p></li>
  	<li><p><strong><em>26 September</em></strong> - <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> , <strong>Big Data</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong></p></li>
  	<li><p><strong><em>31 October</em></strong> - How <strong>Electric/Autonomous Vehicles</strong> will revolutionise mobility and change the way our cities are organised.</p></li>
  	<li><p><strong><em>November</em></strong> - <strong>Hackathon</strong> Weekend Event - Details to come.</p></li>
  </ul>



<h3>Background</h3>

<p>WWF Australia, Greenups and EnergyLab are partnering on a fascinating event series exploring the role emerging technology can play to help solve some of our biggest environmental and social challenges.</p>

<p>We are living through a period of rapid development and witnessing exciting changes in emerging technologies which are redefining how we live, work and play. But global megatrends like climate disruption, resource scarcity, rapid extinction, massive urbanisation and inequality are threatening to derail a potential bright future. As emerging technologies become mainstream, industries and businesses are reorganising to avoid disruption, the lines between for- and non-profit are blurring, and trust is being lost in traditionally powerful institutions.  </p>

<h3>Program Partners</h3>

<p>The Greenhouse 2017 program is presented by three well known and well respected organisations.</p>

<h4>Greenups</h4>

<p>Sydney's Green Drinks and Sustainability Network, is a volunteer-run, community-focused organisation who over the past 8 years have successfully hosted over 100 events designed to inspire and support creative solutions to the environmental and sustainability challenges of Sydney, her people and the planet.</p>

<h4>EnergyLab</h4>

<p>Australia's leading hub, connector and accelerator of new business and technological initiatives that move Australia and the world toward 100% clean energy.</p>

<p>Behind EnergyLab is a vision of a world powered by 100% clean energy, and a team dedicated to helping the startups who are making that dream a reality.  </p>

<p>EnergyLab was founded to support new business and technological initiatives that move Australia and the world toward 100% clean energy solutions</p>

<h4>WWF Australia</h4>

<p>WWF has a long and proud history. A leading voice for nature for more than half a century, working in 100 countries on six continents with the help of over five million Passionate and dedicated supporters.</p>

<p>WWF partners with governments, businesses, communities and individuals to address a range of pressing environmental issues. WWF's work is founded on science, reach international and mission exact - to create a world where people live and prosper in harmony with nature.</p>

<p>As the seventh largest member of the WWF Network, WWF-Australia has a challenging brief - striving to conserve biodiversity in Australia and throughout the Oceania region.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship Opportunity</h3>

<p>Through the combined reach of the three organising partners the strategic engagement opportunity of The Greenhouse Project is targeted and significant.  </p>

<h4>Audience</h4>

<p>Over the course of the live event program we'll connect with over a 1,000 of Sydney's most engaged and dynamic influencers, thought-leaders, creators and doers.  </p>

<p>The Greenhouse attracts business decision makers, civil society, government, students, hackers, activists and an engaged general public, from a diverse range of industries and sectors but with a specific focus on the creative and design, tech and startup, new energy, nfp, education, arts and media.</p>

<h4>Market</h4>

<p>The 6 month timeframe will offer those groups engaged in the program the opportunity to deeply infuse their brand and message into The Greenhouse conversation.</p>

<p>That 'in the room' engagement will then be amplified by ongoing online conversations via Social Media, and via live-streams blogs, video podcast content and mailing-lists.</p>

<h4>Reach</h4>

<p class="text-primary" >The combined reach of the three partnering groups is over 1,000,000+ offering an order N engaged and loyal viewership for the live broadcast.</p>

<h3>The Greenhouse Project 2017 Program Details</h3>

<p><em>How can technology be channelled to help solve some of the big problems we face today?</em></p>

<p><em>How can environment organisations and NGOs think more like technology companies - who innovate fast and take risks with high reward?</em></p>

<p><em>And how can tech companies think more like NGOs, who approach problem solving through strategy, science and rigour? Where are the opportunities for us to collaborate?</em></p>

<p><em>We need to try new things, take risks, experiment with innovative approaches to how we solve problems. And break out of our silos and collaborate with unlikely allies.</em></p>

<p>This event series is designed to help think through some of these opportunities based on different challenges we face, and hopefully form new alliances between some hitherto disconnected communities.</p>

<p><strong>Event series:  Last Tuesday of the month</strong></p>

<p>The event series will facilitate wide ranging panel discussions, along with audience participation. We will launch with an exploration of current exciting trends in technology and explore the intersection between tech and sustainability.</p>

<h3>Time</h3>

<p>6:00pm - 9:00pm  (talks and presentations commence at 7pm)</p>

<h3>Venue</h3>

<p><strong>Energy Lab</strong> <br/>4-12 Buckland St, Chippendale NSW 2008</p>
