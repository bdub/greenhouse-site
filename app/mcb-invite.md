Hi Mike 

(and Hi Scott (but this is mainly to Mike :-) )), 

I'm writing to inquire if you are available (willing, and interested) in taking part in a panel discussion at the launch of [The Greenhouse](http://greenhouse.org.au/) 2017 program series , presented by [WWF](http://www.wwf.org.au/), [Greenups](http://greenups.net/), [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/institute-sustainable-futures) and the [City of Sydney](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/), exploring __how Design/Technology and Innovation can help solve some of the big environmental and sustainability challenges of our time.__

The theme of the launch-night panel discussion is __"Technology and the Environment, what are the Mega Trends?"__

The date is __Tuesday 30th of May__ (6pm to 9pm - panel at 7pm)

Venue: [EnergyLabs,](http://energylab.org.au/) UTS Blackfriars, Broadway.

The other panelists will be: 

* [Dermot O'Gorman](http://www.wwf.org.au/about-us/leaders/dermot-ogorman) - CEO,  WWF Australia
* [Jess Scully](http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/council/about-council/councillors/councillor-jess-scully) - VIVID Ideas founder, TEDx Sydney curator and Councillor with City of Sydney 
* [Kim McKay](https://australianmuseum.net.au/staff/kim-mckay) - CEO, Australian Museum
* [Fiona Simson](http://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2016-11-24/fiona-simson-new-national-farmers-federation-president/8052758) - President, National Farmers' Federation (tbc)
* [Ben Waters](https://linkedin.com/in/bdwaters) (MC/moderator) - Founder/Director, Presync

The six-month event program begins with a series of monthly idea-exchanging meetups designed to foster a inter-industry community of interest around some of these big challenges, and will culminate in design/hack/athon to kickstart some of the solutions that will hopefully have percolated up through the program. 

Considering your recent foray in to the Australian clean energy debate, and your status as a titan of Australian Tech we'd love your support for this project. 

I look forward to hearing from you about your interest and availability for the event on Tuesday 30th of May, and if you had any time available for a quick chat, i'd love the opportunity to discuss the programâ€™s broader aims with you in more detail.

Cheers
Benjamin Ward
